    <h2>Information:</h2>
    <p>Tyrannosaurus is a genus of large theropod dinosaur. The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in Latin),
        often called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the best represented theropods. Tyrannosaurus lived
        throughout what
        is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much
        wider range
        than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of
        the Upper Cretaceous period,
        68 to 66 million years ago. It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids and among the last non-avian
        dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene
        extinction event.
    </p>

    <h2>FootPrints</h2>
    <p>Two isolated fossilized footprints have been tentatively assigned to T. rex. The first was discovered at Philmont
        Scout Ranch,
        New Mexico, in 1983 by American geologist Charles Pillmore. Originally thought to belong to a hadrosaurid,
        examination of the footprint
        revealed a large 'heel' unknown in ornithopod dinosaur tracks, and traces of what may have been a hallux, the
        dewclaw-like fourth digit of the
        tyrannosaur foot. The footprint was published as the ichnogenus Tyrannosauripus pillmorei in 1994, by Martin
        Lockley and Adrian Hunt. Lockley and
        Hunt suggested that it was very likely the track was made by a T. rex, which would make it the first known
        footprint from this species. The track was
        made in what was once a vegetated wetland mudflat. It measures 83 centimeters (33 in) long by 71 centimeters (28
        in) wide.

    <h2>Arms</h2>
    <p>When T. rex was first discovered, the humerus was the only element of the forelimb known. For the initial mounted
        skeleton as seen by the public in 1915, Osborn substituted longer, three-fingered forelimbs like those of
        Allosaurus.
        A year earlier, Lawrence Lambe described the short, two-fingered forelimbs of the closely related
        Gorgosaurus.This
        strongly suggested that T. rex had similar forelimbs, but this hypothesis was not confirmed until the first
        complete
        T. rex forelimbs were identified in 1989, belonging to MOR 555 (the "Wankel rex"). The remains of Sue also
        include complete forelimbs. T. rex arms are very small relative to overall body size, measuring only 1 meter
        (3.3 ft)
        long, and some scholars have labelled them as vestigial. The bones show large areas for muscle attachment,
        indicating considerable
        strength. This was recognized as early as 1906 by Osborn, who speculated that the forelimbs may have been used
        to grasp a mate during
        copulation. It has also been suggested that the forelimbs were used to assist the animal in rising from a prone
        position.
